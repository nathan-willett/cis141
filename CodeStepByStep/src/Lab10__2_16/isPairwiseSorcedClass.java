/*
 * Write a static method called isPairwiseSorted that takes an array of integers as a parameter and that returns whether or 
 * not the array is pairwise sorted. An array is considered to be pairwise sorted if it contains a sequence of pairs where 
 * each pair is in sorted (nondecreasing) order. For example, if a variable list is defined as follows:
 * int[] list = {3, 8, 2, 15, -3, 5, 2, 3, 4, 4};
 * then the call isPairwiseSorted(list) would return true because the array is composed of a sequence of pairs that are each 
 * in sorted order ((3, 8) followed by (2, 15), followed by (-3, 5), and so on). If the array has an odd length, then your 
 * method should ignore the value at the end. Below are several examples of what value would be returned for a given array.
