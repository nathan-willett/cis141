/*
 * 
 * Write a method named circleArea that accepts the radius of a circle as a parameter (as a real number) and 
 * returns the area of a circle with that radius. For example, the call of circleArea(2.0) should return 
 * 12.566370614359172. You may assume that the radius passed is a non-negative number.
