 * Write a method named boxOfStars that accepts two integer parameters representing a width and height in characters, and prints to the console a 'box' figure 
 * whose border is * stars and whose center is made of spaces. For example, the call of boxOfStars(8, 5); should print the following output:
 *
 *   ********
 *   *      *
 *   *      *
 *   *      *
 *   ********
 * 
 * You may assume that the values passed for the width and height are at least 2.
