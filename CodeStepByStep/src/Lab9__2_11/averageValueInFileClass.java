/*
 * Write a method named averageValueInFile that accepts a file name as a parameter and reads that file, assumed to be full 
 * of real numbers, and returns the average (mean) of the numbers in that file. The parameter, filename, gives the name of 
 * a file that contains a list of real numbers, one per line. You may assume that the file exists and follows the proper 
 * format. 
 * 
 * For example, if a file named input.txt contains the following numbers
 * 
 * 1.5
 * 2.75
 * 9.0
 * -3.25
 * 0.0
 * 6.5
 * 
 * Then the call of averageValueInFile("input.txt"); should return 2.75.
 * You may assume that the input file exists and is in the proper format. If the file does not contain any input values, 
 * return 0.0.
 * Constraints: Your solution should read the file only once, not make multiple passes over the file data.
