/*
 * Write a static method called tallyScores that takes as a parameter a Scanner containing a series of student 
 * records and that prints a summary of each student record. A student record will begin with a name followed
 * by a sequence of integer test scores. The name is guaranteed to be one word composed of letters. You may 
 * assume that each student has at least one test score. Your method should produce two lines of output for each 
 * student: one showing the student's name and test scores and a second line showing the average score. For 
 * example, if a Scanner called records contains the following:
 */
public class tallyScoresClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner console = new Scanner(System.in);
    }

    public static void tallyScores(Scanner console) {

    }
}
