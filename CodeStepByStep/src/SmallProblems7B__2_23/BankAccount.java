/*
 * Add the following method to the BankAccount class: 
 * 
 * public String toString()
 * 
 * Your method should return a string that contains the account's name and balance separated by a
 * comma and space. For example, if an account object named benben has the name "Benson" and a
 * balance of 17.25, the call of benben.toString() should return:
 * 
 * Benson, $17.25
 * 
 * There are some special cases you should handle. If the balance is negative, put the - sign before the
 * dollar sign. Also, always display the cents as a two-digit number. For example, if the same object had
 * a balance of -17.5, your method should return:
 * 
 * Benson, -$17.50
