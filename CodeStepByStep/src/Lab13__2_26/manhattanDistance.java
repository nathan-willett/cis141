/*
 * Add the following method to the Point class:
 * 
 * public int manhattanDistance(Point other)
 * 
 * Returns the "Manhattan distance" between the current Point object and the given other Point object. 
 * The Manhattan distance refers to how far apart two places are if the person can only travel straight 
 * horizontally or vertically, as though driving on the streets of Manhattan. In our case, the Manhattan 
 * distance is the sum of the absolute values of the differences in their coordinates; in other words, 
 * the difference in x plus the difference in y between the points.
