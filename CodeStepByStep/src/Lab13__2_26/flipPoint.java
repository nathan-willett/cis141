 * Negates and swaps the x/y coordinates of the Point object. For example, if the object
 * initially represents the point (5, -3), after a call to flip, the object should represent 
 * (3, -5). If the object initially represents the point (4, 17), after a call to flip, the 
 * object should represent (-17, -4).
